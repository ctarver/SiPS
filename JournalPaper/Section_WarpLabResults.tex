\section{\textsc{Warp}Lab Results}
\label{sec:WARPLabResults}
The methods presented previously in the paper were tested using the \textsc{Warp}Lab framework on the \textsc{Warp}v3 board. 
\textsc{Warp} is a software-defined radio platform that allows for rapid prototyping by interfacing with \textsc{Matlab} to perform the baseband signal processing  \cite{warpProject}. 
A photo of the experimental setup is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:exp_setup}. 
For these experiments, the DPD processing is done on the host CPU, but the broadcasting is done on the \textsc{Warp} radio hardware which includes the Maxim MAX2829 transceiver and the Anadigics AWL6951 PA.

\subsection{IM3$\pm$ Iterations}
We began by testing the iterative method presented in Section \ref{sec:Analysis}. 
An LTE uplink signal was generated in \textsc{Matlab} with two non-contiguous carriers. 
One carrier was 3 MHz and the other was 1.4 MHz. 
Both carriers had 64 QAM subcarrier modulation. 
The frequency domain results at each iteration are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:RightThenLeft}. 
The IM3+ spur was trained first using seventh-order DPD processing, and suppression was achieved as evident in the red curve. 
However, the IM3- spur magnitude was increased slightly which is consistent with (\ref{eq:IM3_-}). 
We then trained the IM3- spur (yellow curve). 
Again, there was a negative effect on the opposite spur, so we retrained the IM3+ spur (purple curve). 
At this point, we were satisfied with the performance and quit training.

\end{figure}

\subsection{IM3$\pm$ and IM5$\pm$ Iterations}
We then performed a similar experiment to the previous. However, the two carriers were set to be 1.4 MHz LTE uplink signals spaced 6 MHz apart. This allowed the IM5 spurs to be observable on the WARP board. For this expierment, we set a threshold that the spurs must be -40 dB below the main carriers.

In the first iteration, we trained the IM3+ spur with a 3rd-order, sub-band DPD. This suppressed the spur below the threshold. Then in the second iteration, we trained the IM3- spur since it was above the threshold. 

\subsection{Sequential Learning}
As presented in Section \ref{sec:Sequential_Learning}, we then tested the sequential learning concept in \textsc{Warp}Lab where we started with low-order nonlinearities and added higher orders as needed. 
In Fig. \ref{fig:ConcurrentConvergence}, we show an example for comparison using the previously developed concurrent training method. 
We then switched to using the new sequential method as seen in Fig. \ref{fig:SequentialConvergence}. For these two experiments, the same LTE uplink signal and setup were used. 
We see that all the coefficients converged to approximately the same value. 
In Fig. \ref{fig:IterativeSpectrumvsConcurrent}, we show the results in the frequency domain on the IM3+ spur. 
From these figures, it is evident that the final result is equivalent and the only difference is the amount of time it takes to train.

\subsection{Speed-up Methods}
The convergence time for sequential training is longer than training in parallel as discussed earlier and shown in Figures \ref{fig:ConcurrentConvergence} and \ref{fig:SequentialConvergence}. 
To overcome this, we tested the previously presented methods for speeding up the convergence time.

We tested the adaptive $\mu$ concept presented by Algorithm 1. 
In Fig. \ref{fig:Convergence_Mu}, we show the correlation between the error block and the LMS reference block as the algorithm converges. 
As the DPD coefficient convergences (shown in blue), the correlation decreases (shown in orange). 
When it is below the threshold ($\gamma$) of 0.05 (shown in red) more than 5 times (the confidence metric, $\nu$), the learning rate changes from $\mu = 4$ to $\mu = 0.7$. 
This change of $\mu$ is denoted by the dashed line. 
The values were determined experimentally to what worked well for a variety of scenarios as determined by the authors. 

\begin{figure}[t!]

\caption{Correlation vs. block index during DPD training. 
	As training progresses the correlation decreases. 
	Once it is below the threshold for a total number of times greater than the confidence metric, we change to the lower learning rate.}
\label{fig:Convergence_Mu}

\end{figure}

We then tested the concept of starting the DPD coefficient at a value based off the interpolation of other trained values. 
When using WARPLab, there is an RF gain parameter that sets the gain for the PA. This value is an integer between zero and sixty-three with approximately half a dB of gain per increase unit. We started with an RF gain parameter of 45 where we trained from a starting point of zero. Then, we increased the RF gain to 55 where we again trained from 0. At each, the coefficients converged smoothly with sufficient suppression. 

We then choose to work at an RF gain of 50. We linearly interpolated from the two values previously stored. We then started training from this point. The training is shown in Figure \ref{fig:Interpolate}. Based off the sequential, LMS training, a small update to the interpolation guess is made.

\centering
\includegraphics[]{Figures/Interpolate}
\caption{Convergence of the DPD coefficients after interpolating from previous coefficients.}
\label{fig:Interpolate}
%\vspace{-10pt}
\end{figure}

 As we continue to transmit under various conditions, the interpolations become more accurate. Eventually, a complete table of DPD coefficients is formed. Then whenever we need to broadcast, we can simply load the previous coefficients and quickly update them to account for small fluctuations if needed.
